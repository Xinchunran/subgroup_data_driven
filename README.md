# subgroup_data_driven
subgroup on the evolvability


this repo serves as the repo for enzyme evolvability analysis

Week 1: **alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily and related evolutionary analysis.** 
        Data source:
		ESTerase database: http://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/ESTHER/general?what=index **
		MEROPS database: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/**
		CAZy database: https://www.uniprot.org/database/DB-0136 
	Software: 
		Mega, ClustalW/omega, MSA analysis, DCA, Simth-waterman, Phylogenetic tree construction

Week 2: **Substrates-sequences annotation**
